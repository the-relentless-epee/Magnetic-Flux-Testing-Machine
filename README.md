# Magnetic-Flux-Testing-Machine
A machine to collect data on how magnetic flux changes over distance. The end goal is to test how the air gap in an electric motor affects its performance. The machine involves spinning a disc of neodynium magnets next to a coil. The distance between the magnet disc and the coil is changed using a stepper motor, and the voltage across the coil is measured.
